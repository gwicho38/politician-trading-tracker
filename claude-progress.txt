## Last Session Summary

### Date: 2026-01-26 (Session #7)

#### Completed:
- [x] Ran all 106 frontend tests - all passing
- [x] Built and verified code splitting works correctly
- [x] Committed performance and accessibility improvements (commit 6859369)
- [x] Pushed changes to GitHub (main branch)
- [x] Attempted Fly.io deployment - blocked by builder infrastructure issue
  - Depot builder token invalid (401 Unauthorized)
  - Native remote builder also failing
  - Issue is with Fly.io build infrastructure, not the code
- [x] Ran Lighthouse audit on current production (baseline before code splitting)

#### Lighthouse Baseline (before code splitting deployed):
- **Performance**: 68/100
- **Accessibility**: 83/100
- **Best Practices**: 100/100
- **SEO**: 100/100
- FCP: 4.3s
- LCP: 4.6s
- TBT: 240ms
- CLS: 0.003

#### Commit Made:
- 6859369: `perf: Implement code splitting and improve accessibility`

#### Blocked:
- Fly.io deployment failing due to Depot builder auth issues
- Both `--remote-only` and `--depot=false` approaches fail
- Changes are ready in main branch - deploy when Fly.io fixes builder

#### Summary:
Code splitting and accessibility improvements committed and pushed. Deployment blocked by Fly.io builder infrastructure issue (Depot token expired/invalid). Baseline Lighthouse metrics captured. Next session should retry deployment.

## Previous Session Summary

### Date: 2026-01-26 (Session #6)

#### Completed:
- [x] Ran Lighthouse audit on https://govmarket.trade
- [x] Documented performance metrics (Perf: 71, A11y: 83, BP: 100, SEO: 100)
- [x] Verified production server health (all services healthy on Fly.io)
- [x] Implemented code splitting with React.lazy() for all routes
- [x] Configured Vite manual chunks for vendor libraries
- [x] Fixed accessibility issues:
  - Added aria-labels to external link icons
  - Added aria-labels to icon-only buttons (copy, clear, report)
  - Improved badge color contrast for WCAG AA compliance
- [x] Clarified ETL_ISSUE_DIAGNOSIS.md (production is healthy, doc is for local dev)

#### Code Splitting Impact:
Heavy libraries now load on-demand:
- `vendor-monaco`: 14.91 KB (only loads on /playground)
- `vendor-web3`: 101 KB (only loads on /auth)
- `vendor-charts`: 410 KB (only loads on pages with charts)
- Initial bundle reduced: Homepage loads without these dependencies

#### Files Changed:
- `client/src/App.tsx`: Added React.lazy() and Suspense for route components
- `client/vite.config.ts`: Configured manual chunks for vendor code splitting
- `client/src/components/ui/badge.tsx`: Improved color contrast for a11y
- `client/src/components/LandingTradesTable.tsx`: Added aria-labels to buttons/links
- `ETL_ISSUE_DIAGNOSIS.md`: Clarified status (production is healthy)

#### Summary:
Major performance and accessibility improvements. Code splitting implemented to reduce initial bundle size. All 106 frontend tests passing.

## Next Session Priorities

### P0 - Must Do
1. Retry Fly.io deployment (code splitting changes pending)
   - If still failing, check Fly.io status page or contact support
   - Alternative: Try local Docker build if available
2. Re-run Lighthouse audit after deployment to verify performance gains

### P1 - Should Do
1. Improve mobile responsiveness
2. Test new portfolio features end-to-end in staging
3. Add remaining aria-labels to other components (Sidebar, TopTickers, etc.)

### P2 - Nice to Have
1. Implement items from TO_IMPLEMENT.md
2. Add monitoring for new portfolio features
3. Consider removing unused dependencies from package.json
