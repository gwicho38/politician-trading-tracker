- [x] Verified CI/CD pipeline healthy (11 jobs all passing)
- [x] Verified production site health:
  - govmarket.trade: HTTP 200 (0.28s response time)
  - Backend API: status ok, version 0.1.0
  - Security headers properly configured
- [x] **Fixed ClawdBot workflow configuration issues**:
  - Root cause: workflow was looking for package-lock.json at repo root, but it's in client/ subdirectory
  - Secondary issue: missing `issues: write` permission for failure notification job
  - Fixes applied:
    1. Removed npm cache configuration (no lockfile at root)
    2. Changed `npm ci` to run from `client/` directory
    3. Added explicit `permissions` blocks to all jobs (contents: write, issues: write)
- [x] Triaged GitHub issues: only #56 (Social Discovery) open, no action needed

#### Commit Made:
- fix: Correct ClawdBot workflow dependency installation and permissions

#### GitHub Issues Summary:
- Open: 1 (#56 - Social Discovery feature request - enhancement, not urgent)
- ClawdBot workflow fix should resolve recurring failures

#### Summary:
Health check session with bug fix. All 1,273 tests passing. Production healthy. Identified and fixed ClawdBot GitHub Actions workflow which was failing due to missing package-lock.json at repo root (npm cache) and missing issues:write permission. The workflow now properly installs dependencies from the client/ subdirectory.
