## ✅ Completed Loop #31
- [2026-01-28] 🏗️ **Robustness: Fix UnboundLocalError in get_senators()**
  - **Bug**: `get_senators()` endpoint failed with `UnboundLocalError` when Supabase was unavailable
  - **Root Cause**: `with_disclosures` and `total_disclosures` variables were initialized inside the try block (line 487-488), so when `get_senate_supabase_client()` threw an exception, they were never defined
  - **Fix**: Moved variable initialization before the try block, ensuring they're always defined
  - **Result**: Endpoint now gracefully returns senators with zero counts when Supabase fails (as originally intended)
  - Updated test to verify graceful handling (200 with zero counts) instead of documenting buggy behavior (500)
  - Files modified: `app/routes/etl.py`, `tests/test_etl_routes.py`
  - All 1486 tests passing

## ✅ Completed Loop #10
- [2026-01-28] 🔒 **Security: Constant-Time Comparison for Service Role Keys**

    - Tests for `constantTimeCompare()` different length strings
    - Updated `isServiceRoleRequest()` tests to use new implementation

  - All 923 tests passing

- [2026-01-28] 🔒 **Security Audit: Comprehensive Review**
  - Audited all services: ETL (Python), Phoenix (Elixir), Client (React), Edge Functions
  - **Critical findings**:
    - ETL service had NO authentication (now fixed with AuthMiddleware)
    - Phoenix server has no auth middleware (needs implementation)
    - Edge Functions use wildcard CORS (*) - security risk
    - Alpaca credentials stored unencrypted in database

- [2026-01-28] 🛡️ **Data Quality: Trade Amount Validation**

  - Added 19 tests in `test_database.py` covering all validation scenarios
  - Prevents future volume spike issues from PDF parsing errors
  - All 849 tests passing

- [2026-01-28] 🗃️ **Data Quality: Volume Spike Fix**
  - **Issue**: Massive volume spike in Aug-Sep 2025 on Trade Volume chart (~$4.5B displayed)
  - **Root Cause**: 37 corrupted `trading_disclosures` records with impossible amounts (up to $4.5 trillion) from House ETL PDF parsing errors
  - **Parser Bug**: Concatenating multiple columns/rows into `asset_name` field, extracting dollar amounts from malformed text
  - **Example**: `asset_name: "Truway Health, Inc. Suing the U.S $4,536,758,654,345.00..."` with `amount_range_max: 4536758654345`
  - **Fix Applied**:
    1. Deleted 37 corrupted records where `amount_range_max > $1 billion`
    2. Regenerated `chart_data` table via `update-chart-data` edge function
  - **Result**: Sep 2025 volume now shows ~$1.4B (realistic) instead of ~$898B (corrupt)

- [2026-01-28] 🔒 **Security: Sandbox fail-closed + RestrictedPython dependency fix**
  - Added RestrictedPython>=6.1 to pyproject.toml (was missing from deps)
